Chrome Plugin Example
=====================

This repository is boilerplate to start writing a javascript extension for the chrome webbrowser.

Right now, it causes an alert box to pop up every time you search or otherwise visit www.google.com.  It can be changed to do anything else that could happen because of javascript running in a web page.  It can do even more by running code in the background that persists between different page reloads.

Official Tutorial
-----------------
The official documentation for chrome extensions also provides instructions for starting from scratch.  It will cover more topics than this exercise, but feel free to try it out: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

Use this repository instead if you want to shortcut straight to writing browser javascript.

Installing You Extension
------------------------

⚠️ Don't install random extensions you find on the internet; they are not safe. ⚠️

Read the code here before adding it to your browser to make certain it doesn't do anything nefarious.

1. Download this repo (git checkout, zip file, or download individual files).
2. Turn on developer mode in [chrome extension settings](chrome://extensions/)
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder with the files.
